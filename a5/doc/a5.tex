\section{Kernel Logistic Regresion}

If you run \verb|python main.py -q 1| it will load a synthetic 2D data set, split it into train/validation sets, and then perform regular logistic regression and kernel logistic regression (both without an intercept term, for simplicity). You'll observe that the error values and plots generated look the same since the kernel being used is the linear kernel (i.e., the kernel corresponding to no change of basis).

\subsection{Implementing kernels}
\rubric{code:5}

 \blu{Implement the polynomial kernel and the RBF kernel for logistic regression. Make sure to include the code you have written in your pdf GradeScope submission. Report your training/validation errors and submit the plots generated for each case}. You should use the hyperparameters $p=2$ and $\sigma=0.5$ respectively, and $\lambda=0.01$ for the regularization strength.

\ans{ \\
	Polynomial kernel: \\
	Training error 0.183 \\
	Validation error 0.170 \\
	RBF kernel: \\
	Training error 0.127 \\
	Validation error 0.090 \\
	Below are the code and the figures for polynomial and RBF kernels, respectively.
}

\begin{lstlisting}[style = base]
In logReg.py:

def kernel_RBF(X1, X2, sigma=0.5):
	return np.exp(- (utils.euclidean_dist_squared(X1, X2)) / (2 * sigma** 2))

def kernel_poly(X1, X2, p=2):
	return (1 + X1@X2.T)**p

In main.py: 

	 # kernel logistic regression with a polynomial kernel
	lr_kernel = kernelLogRegL2(kernel_fun=logReg.kernel_poly, lammy=0.01, p = 2)
	lr_kernel.fit(Xtrain, ytrain)
	
	print("Training error %.3f" % np.mean(lr_kernel.predict(Xtrain) != ytrain))
	print("Validation error %.3f" % np.mean(lr_kernel.predict(Xtest) != ytest))
	
	utils.plotClassifier(lr_kernel, Xtrain, ytrain)
	utils.savefig("logRegPolynomialKernel.png")
	
	
	
	# kernel logistic regression with a RBF kernel
	lr_kernel = kernelLogRegL2(kernel_fun=logReg.kernel_RBF, lammy=0.01, sigma = 0.5)
	lr_kernel.fit(Xtrain, ytrain)
	
	print("Training error %.3f" % np.mean(lr_kernel.predict(Xtrain) != ytrain))
	print("Validation error %.3f" % np.mean(lr_kernel.predict(Xtest) != ytest))
	
	utils.plotClassifier(lr_kernel, Xtrain, ytrain)
	utils.savefig("logRegRBFKernel.png")
	
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Hyperparameter search}
\rubric{code:3}

For the RBF kernel logistic regression, consider the hyperparameters values $\sigma=10^m$ for $m=-2,-1,\ldots,2$ and $\lambda=10^m$ for $m=-4,-3,\ldots,0$. \blu{In \texttt{main.py}, sweep over the possible combinations of these hyperparameter values. Make sure to include the code you have written in your pdf GradeScope submission. Report the hyperparameter values that yield the best training error and the hyperparameter values that yield the best validation error. Include the plot for each.}

Note: on the job you might choose to use a tool like scikit-learn's \texttt{GridSearchCV} to implement the grid search, but here we are asking you to implement it yourself by looping over the hyperparameter values.


\ans{$(\sigma = 10^m, \lambda = 10^n)$ yields the best training error when $(m, n)$ is one of $(-2,-4), (-2, -3), (-2, -2), (-2, -1), (-2, 0)$ and $(\sigma = 10^m, \lambda = 10^n)$ yields the best validation error when $(m,n)$ is one of $(-1, 0), (0,0)$. The plots below are in the order that these tuples are listed.}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=base]
	for m in range(-2,3):
		for n in range(-4,1):
			# kernel logistic regression with a RBF kernel where sigma = 10^m and lambda = 10^n
			lr_kernel = kernelLogRegL2(kernel_fun=logReg.kernel_RBF, lammy=10**n, sigma = 10**m)
			lr_kernel.fit(Xtrain, ytrain)
			
			print("Training error %.3f" % np.mean(lr_kernel.predict(Xtrain) != ytrain))
			print("Validation error %.3f" % np.mean(lr_kernel.predict(Xtest) != ytest))
			
			utils.plotClassifier(lr_kernel, Xtrain, ytrain)
			utils.savefig("logRegRBFKernel_m=" + str(m) + "_n=" + str(n) + ".png")        		
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Reflection}
\rubric{reasoning:1}

Briefly discuss the best hyperparameters you found in the previous part, and their associated plots. Was the training error minimized by the values you expected, given the ways that $\sigma$ and $\lambda$ affect the fundamental tradeoff?

\ans{The erros were minimized by the the expected hyperparameters. The pairs with the lowest $\sigma$ have the least training error and therefore also give the most overfitting models. The pairs with the highest $\lambda$ have the least validation error because there is much more focus on regularization. These lead to the simplest models.}

\section{MAP Estimation}
\rubric{reasoning:8}

In class, we considered MAP estimation in a regression model where we assumed that:
\items{
\item The likelihood $p(y_i \mid x_i, w)$ is a normal distribution with a mean of $w^Tx_i$ and a variance of $1$.
\item The prior for each variable $j$, $p(w_j)$, is a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of $\lambda^{-1}$.
}
Under these assumptions, we showed that this leads to the standard L2-regularized least squares objective function,
\[
f(w) = \frac{1}{2}\norm{Xw - y}^2 + \frac \lambda 2 \norm{w}^2,
\]
which is the negative log likelihood (NLL) under these assumptions (ignoring an irrelevant constant).
\blu{For each of the alternate assumptions below, show how the loss function would change} (simplifying as much as possible):
\enum{
\item We use a Laplace likelihood with a mean of $w^Tx_i$ and a scale of $1$, and we use a zero-mean Gaussian prior with a variance of $\sigma^2$.
\[
p(y_i \mid x_i, w) = \frac 1 2 \exp(-|w^Tx_i - y_i|), \quad p(w_j) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp\left(-\frac{w_j^2}{2\sigma^2}\right).
\]
\item We use a Gaussian likelihood where each datapoint has its own variance $\sigma_i^2$, and where we use a zero-mean Laplace prior with a vairance of $\lambda^{-1}$.
\[
p(y_i \mid x_i,w) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\sigma_i^2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{(w^Tx_i - y_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2}\right), \quad p(w_j) = \frac{\lambda}{2}\exp(-\lambda|w_j|).
\]
You can use $\Sigma$ as a diagonal matrix that has the values $\sigma_i^2$ along the diagonal.
\item We use a (very robust) student $t$ likelihood with a mean of $w^Tx_i$ and $\nu$ degrees of freedom, and a zero-mean Gaussian prior with a variance of $\lambda^{-1}$,
\[
p(y_i | x_i, w) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\nu\pi}\Gamma\left(\frac \nu 2\right)}\left(1 + \frac{(w^Tx_i - y_i)^2}{\nu}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}, \quad p(w_j) = \frac{\sqrt{\lambda}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\lambda\frac{w_j^2}{2}\right).
\]
where $\Gamma$ is the ``gamma" function (which is always non-negative).
\item We use a Poisson-distributed likelihood (for the case where $y_i$ represents counts), and we use a uniform prior for some constant $\kappa$,
\[
p(y_i | w^Tx_i) = \frac{\exp(y_iw^Tx_i)\exp(-\exp(w^Tx_i))}{y_i!}, \quad p(w_j) \propto \kappa.
\]
(This prior is 	``improper'' since $w\in\R^d$ but it doesn't integrate to 1 over this domain, but nevertheless the posterior will be a proper distribution.)
}
\ans{ \\By ignoring additive constants, the above correspond with the loss functions: \\1. $f(w) = \norm{Xw - y}_1 + \frac{\norm{w}^2}{2 \sigma^2}$
\\ 2. $f(w) = \frac{1}{2} \norm{\Sigma^{-1}(Xw - y)}^2 + \lambda \norm{w}_1$
\\ 3. $f(w) = -\frac{\nu + 1}{2} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\log \left(1 + \frac{(w^{T} x_i - y_i)^2}{\nu} \right) + \frac{\lambda}{2} \norm{w}^2$
\\ 4. $f(w) = \sum_{i = 1}^n [y_i w^T x_i - \exp(w^T x_i)] = y^TXw - \sum_{i = 1}^n \exp(w^T x_i)$}


\section{Principal Component Analysis}
\rubric{reasoning:3}


Consider the following dataset, containing 5 examples with 2 features each:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
$x_1$ & $x_2$\\
\hline
-4 & 3\\
0 & 1\\
-2 & 2\\
4 & -1\\
2 & 0\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Recall that with PCA we usually assume that the PCs are normalized ($\norm{w} = 1$), we need to center the data before we apply PCA, and that the direction of the first PC is the one that minimizes the orthogonal distance to all data points.
\blu{
\enum{
\item What is the first principal component?
\item What is the reconstruction loss (L2 norm squared) of the point (-3, 2.5)? (Show your work.)
\item What is the reconstruction loss (L2 norm squared) of the point (-3, 2)? (Show your work.)
}
}
Hint: it may help (a lot) to plot the data before you start this question.



\section{PCA Generalizations}

\subsection{Robust PCA}
\rubric{code:10}

If you run \verb|python main -q 4.1| the code will load a dataset $X$ where each row contains the pixels from a single frame of a video of a highway. The demo applies PCA to this dataset and then uses this to reconstruct the original image.
It then shows the following 3 images for each frame:
\enum{
\item The original frame.
\item The reconstruction based on PCA.
\item A binary image showing locations where the reconstruction error is non-trivial.
}
Recently, latent-factor models have been proposed as a strategy for ``background subtraction'': trying to separate objects from their background. In this case, the background is the highway and the objects are the cars on the highway. In this demo, we see that PCA does an OK job of identifying the cars on the highway in that it does tend to identify the locations of cars. However, the results aren't great as it identifies quite a few irrelevant parts of the image as objects.

Robust PCA is a variation on PCA where we replace the L2-norm with the L1-norm,
\[
f(Z,W) = \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^d |\langle w^j, z_i\rangle - x_{ij}|,
\]
and it has recently been proposed as a more effective model for background subtraction. \blu{Complete the class \emph{pca.RobustPCA},
that uses a smooth approximation to the absolute value to implement robust PCA. Make sure to include the code you have written in your pdf GradeScope submission. Briefly comment on the results.} 

Note: in its current state, \emph{pca.RobustPCA} is just a copy of \emph{pca.AlternativePCA}, which is why the two rows of images are identical.

Hint: most of the work has been done for you in the class \emph{pca.AlternativePCA}.
This work implements an alternating minimization approach to minimizing the (L2) PCA objective (without enforcing orthogonality). This gradient-based approach to PCA can be modified to use a smooth approximation of the L1-norm. Note that the log-sum-exp approximation to the absolute value may be hard to get working due to numerical issues, and a numerically-nicer approach is to use the ``multi-quadric'' approximation:
\[
|\alpha| \approx \sqrt{\alpha^2 + \epsilon},
\]
where $\epsilon$ controls the accuracy of the approximation (a typical value of $\epsilon$ is $0.0001$).



\subsection{Reflection}
\rubric{reasoning:3}

\enum{
\item Briefly explain why using the L1 loss might be more suitable for this task than L2. 
\item How does the number of video frames and the size of each frame relate to $n$, $d$, and/or $k$?
\item What would the effect be of changing the threshold (see code) in terms of false positives (cars we identify that aren't really there) and false negatives (real cars that we fail to identify)?
}

\section{Very-Short Answer Questions}
\rubric{reasoning:11}

\enum{
\item Assuming we want to use the original features (no change of basis) in a linear model, what is an advantage of the ``other'' normal equations over the original normal equations? \\
\ans{There is regularization added (the focus of which is dictated by $\lambda$) so the linear model can have non-zero intercept. }
\item In class we argued that it's possible to make a kernel version of $k$-means clustering. What would an advantage of kernels be in this context?
\ans{We can have non-convex clusters}
\item In the language of loss functions and regularization, what is the difference between MLE and MAP?
\ans{MLE corresponds to using loss functions while MAP corresponds to using loss functions with regularization because there is a prior term $p(w)$ which corresponds to the regularizer.}
\item What is the difference between a generative model and a discriminative model?
\item With PCA, is it possible for the loss to increase if $k$ is increased? Briefly justify your answer.
\item What does ``label switching'' mean in the context of PCA?
\item Why doesn't it make sense to do PCA with $k > d$?
\item In terms of the matrices associated with PCA ($X$, $W$, $Z$, $\hat{X}$), where would an ``eigenface'' be stored?
\item What is an advantage and a disadvantage of using stochatic gradient over SVD when doing PCA?
\ans{An advantage is that it is fast for large inputs. A disadvantage is that the objective function is not jointly convex so you might not find global minima.}
\item Which of the following step-size sequences lead to convergence of stochastic gradient to a stationary point?
\enum{
\item $\alpha^t = 1/t^2$.
\item $\alpha^t = 1/t$.
\item $\alpha^t = 1/\sqrt{t}$.
\item $\alpha^t = 1$.
}
\item We discussed ``global'' vs. ``local'' features for e-mail classification. What is an advantge of using global features, and what is advantage of using local features?
\ans{Global features are used to make generic predictions about a new user while local features are used to make more personalized predictions for that user.}}
